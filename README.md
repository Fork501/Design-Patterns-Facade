# Facade Design Pattern
The Facade Design Pattern creates a single entry point, which does all of the "heavy lifting."

In other words, if a task requires a series of method calls to accomplish, the Facade will allow the consumer to make a single method call, which executes all of the corresponding code.

In this project's example, our Facade is a building.  Our consumer just wants to perform an inspection and only know the results, once everything has been done.  The consumer will not be responsible for knowing all of the elements required to perform an inspection.
